  "The gamification of an idea that I got when reading a PDF on how to become better at drawing in proportions. It's a tiny collection of guessing games where you have to guess what the half or third point is on a scale."

## Motivation

I was teaching myself how to draw and one thing I noticed was that I was really bad at measuring and drawing in
proportions. There were some guides on the internet how you can specifically train yourself to become better at it, and
using one of those guides I actually went ahead and implemented the first 4 lessons as some kind of minigame as a
webapp.

## Implementation

This was my second project using VuetifyJs, which considerably simplified writing this application (although I would
probably have easily done this would it as well). The rest of the implementation actually went quite simple. I had to
get back to working with SVG again, which by this time I already had largely forgot (it's been almost 2 years since I
last worked with that on the [Outworldzilla project](/projects/outworldzilla)), and I decided on doing a very simple
design and implementation.

## Future

More lessons could be added, highscores could be added, and other things, but overall I just didn't need this
application as much as I anticipated, to I left it at this point. It is fully functional and works for me, and I went on
to doing other projects in the meantime.
